# Salary Forecasting - Predictive Analytics

This project was created as a Final Project for a Predictive Analytics course. The purpose of the project is to use past salaries and associated variables to see how possible it would be to forecast salary trajectories over time. The final model was able to make salary predictions based on metropolitan area, year over year change, job titles, and salary history.

The data was prepared using Python. The Decision Tree models were prepared in R. The neural network was built in Python.

The dataset used for this model was accessed from GlassDoor at the following link: https://www.glassdoor.com/research/type/data-sets/
